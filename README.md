> _By interacting with me and supporting me on these platforms, you help me stay motivated to create new mods and make the publicly available. Any monetary support also helps me towards my dream; to spend more time on making mods for Farming Simulator instead of my current day job (as everyone else, I need to finance my IRL life some way or other)._
